## This project is still work-in-progress application and currently has a working backend for some of its feature and FrontEnd is yet to be designed.

## To run please follow the following command to install the required NodeJs Packages:

### You will also need a MongoDB Server. If you are running this application locally start the MongoDB server and Paste your local URL in the *.env* File

### If you have a MongoDB Atlas Server. Paste your MongoDB URL in the *.env* file in the MONGOURI variable.


### After your MongoDB Server has started. Run the application with the following command:
```
nodemon app.js
```

### Tasks Completed

2. Created a Post Route that will allow users to check all the post
